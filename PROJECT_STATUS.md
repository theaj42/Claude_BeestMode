## Project Impact

This project fulfills the original vision of creating an "easy button" installation system that allows users to set up a pre-configured Claude Desktop environment with essential MCP servers, enabling productive AI collaboration from day one without the "fucking around and finding out" exploration phase.

## Testing Innovation

Planning novel testing approach with Carolyn:
- Sit together during installation
- Phone recording of screen and interactions
- Upload video to Claude for analysis
- Structured feedback collection
- Success criteria clearly defined

The project now has a complete foundation (installation, documentation, validation) ready for real-world deployment and user testing.
