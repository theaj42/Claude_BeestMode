# Claude Desktop Setup Project Plan

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Create an "easy button" installation system that allows users to set up a pre-configured Claude Desktop environment with essential MCP servers, enabling productive AI collaboration from day one.

**Target Users**: People with basic CLI comfort who want powerful AI automation without the "fucking around and finding out" exploration phase.

**Success Metrics**: 
- Single command installation (+ 1-2 user questions)
- One Claude Desktop restart maximum
- Successful validation test across all installed MCP servers
- Clear troubleshooting path when issues arise

## Core Architecture

### MCP Server Selection (Core Productivity Pod)
- **CLI Access**: cli-mcp-server (system command execution)
- **Filesystem**: filesystem MCP (file operations with scoped access)
- **Memory**: memory MCP (persistent knowledge graph)
- **Time**: time MCP (temporal awareness)
- **Calendar**: mcp-ical (calendar integration)
- **Git**: git MCP (version control operations)

### Installation Approach
- **Primary**: Shell script with maximum flexibility
- **Platform Strategy**: Modular system (Mac first, Windows/Linux later)
- **Package Management**: Handle both Python (uvx) and Node.js (npx) MCP servers
- **Configuration**: Backup existing config, merge new settings

### Filesystem Scope
- **Default Path**: `/Users/$username/ClaudeDesktop`
- **Structure**: 
  ```
  /Users/$username/ClaudeDesktop/
  ├── projects/ (Git-initialized)
  ├── documents/
  ├── scripts/ (Git-initialized)
  └── logs/
  ```
- **Security**: User can specify additional paths during installation

## Key Features

### Installation Process
1. **Environment Check**: Verify Claude Desktop installation and system requirements
2. **User Questions**: 
   - Filesystem access path (default: `/Users/$username/ClaudeDesktop`)
   - Additional directory access permissions
3. **Backup**: Save existing configuration with timestamp
4. **Install**: Download and configure all MCP servers
5. **Configure**: Merge settings into Claude Desktop config
