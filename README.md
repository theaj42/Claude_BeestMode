# Claude Desktop Setup - Easy Button Installation

**Create a pre-configured Claude Desktop environment with essential MCP servers for productive AI collaboration from day one.**

## Overview

This installer bridges the gap between sophisticated AI automation and mainstream accessibility. Instead of spending hours exploring and configuring MCP servers, users get a working, productive setup with a single command.

## What You Get

### Core MCP Server Pod
- **CLI Access**: Direct system command execution
- **Filesystem**: Scoped file operations and management  
- **Memory**: Persistent knowledge graph across sessions
- **Time**: Temporal awareness and scheduling
- **Calendar**: Apple Calendar integration
- **Git**: Version control operations

### Organized Workspace
```
/Users/username/ClaudeDesktop/
├── projects/    (Git-initialized for development)
├── documents/   (General document storage)
├── scripts/     (Git-initialized for automation)
└── logs/        (System and error logs)
```

### Smart Configuration Management
- Non-destructive installation (backs up existing configs)
- Intelligent configuration merging
- Easy rollback and troubleshooting
- AI-assisted problem solving through filesystem access

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- macOS (Windows/Linux support coming in later phases)
- Claude Desktop installed
- Python 3 and Node.js

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/claude-desktop-setup.git
cd claude-desktop-setup

# Run the installer
./install.sh
```

The installer will:
1. Check your system and existing Claude Desktop installation
2. Ask about filesystem access preferences
3. Backup your current configuration
4. Install and configure core MCP servers
5. Create organized workspace structure
6. Validate the complete setup

### After Installation

1. **Restart Claude Desktop** to load the new configuration
2. **Test the setup**: Ask Claude "What MCP servers do I have available?"
3. **Explore your workspace**: "What's in my ClaudeDesktop directory?"
4. **Start collaborating**: "Help me organize a new project"

## What Makes This Different

### For Users
- **Zero technical exploration required** - productive from day one
- **Curated server selection** - essential tools without bloat
- **Guided onboarding** - clear next steps and usage examples
- **Safety first** - non-destructive installation with easy rollback

### For Developers
- **Modular architecture** - easy to extend and customize
- **Cross-platform foundation** - Windows/Linux support planned
- **Comprehensive validation** - automated testing and health checks
- **Community-friendly** - clear contribution guidelines

## Architecture

### Installation Strategy
- Shell script approach for maximum compatibility
- Modular platform-specific implementations
- Dependency management for both Python (uvx) and Node.js (npx) servers
- Intelligent configuration merging with backup/restore

### MCP Server Selection
The core servers were chosen for maximum productivity impact:
- **CLI + Filesystem**: Direct system interaction
- **Memory**: Persistent context across sessions  
- **Time + Calendar**: Temporal awareness and scheduling
- **Git**: Version control integration

### Security & Scoping
- Filesystem access limited to designated workspace
- User controls additional directory permissions
- All operations logged for accountability
- Git repositories track all changes

## Advanced Usage

### Manual Server Management
```bash
# Install additional MCP servers
./scripts/macos/install-mcp-servers.sh python your-server-name

# Backup current configuration
./scripts/macos/backup-config.sh backup

# Validate installation health
./scripts/common/validation-functions.sh health
```

### Workspace Management
```bash
# Setup custom workspace location
./scripts/macos/setup-filesystem.sh /your/custom/path

# Validate workspace structure
./scripts/macos/setup-filesystem.sh /your/path validate
```

### Troubleshooting
```bash
# Full system validation
./scripts/common/validation-functions.sh complete

# Quick health check
./scripts/common/validation-functions.sh health

# Test MCP connectivity
./scripts/common/validation-functions.sh mcp
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Claude Desktop not found**
- Install Claude Desktop from https://claude.ai/download

**uvx not available**
- Install with: `pip3 install uvx`

**Permission errors**
- Ensure user has write access to configuration directory

**MCP servers not loading**
- Restart Claude Desktop after installation
- Check configuration with: `./scripts/macos/backup-config.sh validate`

### Getting Help

1. **Check the logs**: `~/claude-desktop-setup.log`
2. **Run validation**: `./scripts/common/validation-functions.sh complete`
3. **Ask Claude**: With filesystem access, Claude can help troubleshoot issues directly
